                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p>My name is Perry Cate. I am a Sophomore at Princeton University majoring in
                    Computer Science. This is my website.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Columbia, SC. I was introduced to programming at the
                    age of 12, when some friends and I started making simple browser-based games
                    using a beginner programming language aimed at middle-schoolers. Curiosity got
                    the better of me, and I started to explore other, more robust tools. The summer
                    after my junior year of high school I started work at a local software company
                    that specialized in writing enterprise-grade custom software solutions. I
                    continued working there througought my high school career, and am now studying
                    Computer Science at Princeton University.

                <p>
                    I wrote this simple website as an exercise to brush up on my HTML+CSS skills,
                    and also to make it easier for potential employers to find information about me.
                    (I'm looking for an internship this summer.)

                    This site was designed to be as lightweight as possible, with no additional
                    JavaScript frameworks used. It is hosted on github pages, using namecheap for
                    DNS hosting. (Thanks, GitHub Student Developer Pack!)
