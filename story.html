                <p>
                    Last Summer I took a break from my CS studies to spend 2 months in Beijing,
                    China, at Princeton's intensive Princeton-in-Beijing program. For the duration
                    of the program I spoke only Mandarin Chinese, and learned an entire year's worth
                    over the course of 2 short months. In my spare time I continued to work on my
                    various side projects, including groupme-utils.

                    In Fall 2015 I began my first semester at Princeton University. In addition to
                    my CS classes and side projects, Several friends and I went to various,
                    programming competitions under the team name "Team'); DROP TABLE teams;--". We
                    won 1st place at a Jane Street hackathon at Princeton (eth1) in the fall, as
                    well The Google Games in the Spring.

                    After the conclusion of my internship, I was offered a part-time position at
                    GraySail, which I accepted. I continued to work for them part-time
                    throughout my senior year of high school, and full-time the summer after.
                    By the time I left for college, I had been an employee of GraySail for 15 months
                    total.

                    National High School Programming Competition. Our team of 5 won 2nd place
                    nationally.

                    The summer after my Junior year I interned for a local software company called
                    GraySail. At first I spent my time learning their toolkits and investigating
                    potential new tools for them, such as TypeScript. After a few weeks I started
                    contributing to their main projects, including a research saftey management
                    system (lab inspection/radiation monitoring software) for a nearby university.

                    My high school had no real Computer Science courses, but during my Junior year
                    of high school I self-studied the AP Computer Science Curriculum. This served
                    both as my introduction to Java, and a more rigorous introduction to
                    Object-Oriented programming.

                    During my 10th grade year I was introduced to codecademy.com. My best friend and
                    I had a competition to see who could earn the most points (earned by completing
                    courses), and in the process I learned a lot more about web development,
                    including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP, among many others.

                    After a friend of my Mom's gave me her 15-year-old desktop, I decided to try to
                    fix it and put Linux on it. I learned a lot about hardware that summer. This led
                    to me eventually converting my basement into a workshop, where I earned my
                    spending money for the next few years fixing other people's computers.

                    Near the end of 9th grade I started taking weekend programming classes with an
                    organization called BDPA. My first year we learned ASP.net and Visual Basic,
                    but in the subsequent years of the program we switched to PHP, in addition to
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and many other web development/general programming
                    topics.

                    In early spring 2012 I attended POSSCON, the Palmetto Open Source Software
                    Conference. This was my first time hearing about many Open-Source projects,
                    including Git, and most importantly, Linux. At the suggestion of several
                    developers I met at the conference, when I went home I began experimenting
                    with Ubuntu Linux on my home computer. I would continue to experiment with
                    various Linux distros, and use it to this day.

                    While learning how to factor quadratic equations in my 9th grade math class, we
                    often had very repetitive homework assignments, so I devised a simple
                    ActionScript-based program to solve the factoring programs for me. I enjoyed
                    writing my first useful program so much that I continued to add features long
                    after my math class moved on from factoring problems. I started teaching myself
                    Python 3 to more easily write other, more generally useful programs.

                    It was around this time that I decided that I wanted to be a programmer when I
                    grew up, and in my free time started to research various programming languages.
                    I experimented with several, including Liberty BASIC, before finally settling on
                    ActionScript 2.

                    The summer before 7th grade, a friend of mine introduced me to Scratch, a
                    graphical beginner programming language aimed for people our age. Over the
                    summer and for several years to come, we made Scratch-based games for each
                    other to play.
