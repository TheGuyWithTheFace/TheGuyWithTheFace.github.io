            <p>Here are a few of my projects, activities, and employments that I am most proud of.

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/TheGuyWithTheFace/groupme-utils">GroupMe-Utils</a></h2>
                <p>
                    GroupMe is a popular group messaging service my friends and I use.
                    This past Summer, after a couple years of working with their API for
                    various side projects, I decided to write a more comprehensive API
                    Wrapper in Java. Built on top of the wrapper is a collection of functions for
                    pulling down group data and dumping it to a text file that can be used for further
                    analysis.

                <h2><a href="http://devpost.com/software/pollme">PollMe</a></h2>
                <p>
                    This was an app my friend Ajay Penmatcha and I wrote for HackPrinceton
                    Fall 2015. It was an anonymous location-based app where users post
                    polls for other people to answer. Ajay wrote the iOS frontend, while I
                    wrote the backend.

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/TheGuyWithTheFace/sound-splitter-2">Sound-Splitter</a></h2>
                <p>
                    For my Mandarin Chinese studies, I use a program called Anki to
                    create digital flashcards. To attach audio to accompany each word,
                    I had to split up the longer vocabulary files provided by our teachers.
                    Sound-Splitter is my automated solution for this. Initially, it was
                    a quickly done python script that searched for silent spaces in a given
                    audio file and cut the audio accordingly. I later rewrote a more
                    reliable version in Java that relied more on user input instead.

                <h2>Employment at GraySail, LLC</h2>
                <p>
                    During my 15 month employment at GraySail during high school, I worked on a variety
                    of projects. My first summer I spent researching TypeScript, which was a very new
                    technology at the time. Througought most of my senior year I worked on a much
                    larger project, a comprehensive system to manage lab inspections, inventory, and
                    hazardous materials tracking for a local university. It was written
                    in PHP (language choice based on customer's request, not our choice). Other
                    projects I worked on there included lots of Java using Google Web Toolkit, among
                    other things.
